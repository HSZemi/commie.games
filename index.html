    <h3><small>Step 1:</small>Join the Discord</h3>

    <p><a href="https://discord.gg/t90official">
        <!--    <img src="images/discord-banner.png" alt="Discord banner"/><br>-->

    </a></p>

    <p>
        There is a 10-minute cooldown after you join the Discord,
        during which you cannot react and therefore cannot participate in the drawing.
        For this reason, it makes sense to join way in advance. There's nice people in there, too!
    </p>


    <h3><small>Step 2</small> Make Sure Your Game is Ready to Go</h3>

    <p>You're on the latest patch? All your mods are sorted out? Great!</p>


    <h3><small>Step 3</small> Watch the Stream</h3>

    <p><a href="https://twitch.tv/t90official">
        <!--    <img src="images/twitch-banner.png" alt="Twitch banner"/><br>-->

    <p>Community Games usually happen on Fridays.</p>


    <h3><small>Step 4</small> React With ðŸŽ‰ in #community-games</h3>

    <p><img src="images/community-games-channel.png" alt="#community-games channel in the discord"/></p>

    <p>
        Once the <code>Rig-O-Mat 97.1</code> posts in the <code>#community-games</code> channel,
        react with ðŸŽ‰ to enter the drawing.
    </p>

    <p><img src="images/rig-o-mat-post.png"
            alt="A post by Rig-O-mat 97.1 where you have to react with the ðŸŽ‰ emoji to enter the drawing"/></p>


    <h3><small>Step 5</small> Get Rigged In</h3>

    <p>If you get rigged in, you receive the <code>rigged in</code> role and get access to <code>#cg-chat</code>.
        There, you will receive the game ID and password to join the game.</p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <dl>
        <dt>I am a complete noob, can I still participate?</dt>
        <dd>Yes, of course! There is no rating prerequisite.</dd>
        <dt>Do I need to download special mods to play?</dt>
        <dd>No. The game will download special mods/maps automatically when you join the game.</dd>
        <dt>If I get rigged in twice in a day, can I play in two games?</dt>
        <dd>No, unless T90 says so.</dd>
        <dt>Which game do I need?</dt>
        <dd>Age of Empires II Definitive Edition</dd>
        <dt>Do I need all the expansions to play?</dt>
        <dd>No. The base game is sufficient.</dd>
        <dt>Can I play with the Steam/Xbox/MS Store version of the game?</dt>
        <dd>Steam works, MS Store works, Xbox only works if the game mode does not involve a data mod or custom map.
            This is a technical limitation of that game version.
        </dd>
        <dt>Why can I not react to the post from Rig-O-Mat 97.1?</dt>
        <dd>You probably joined the Discord less than 10 minutes ago.
            There is a 10-minute cooldown before you can chat or react.
        </dd>
        <dt>Do I need Voobly?</dt>
        <dd>No. That was a long time ago.</dd>
        <dt>Is it rigged?</dt>
        <dd>Most definitely.</dd>

    <p>
        You got selected to host a community game?
        Here's what you need to do.
    </p>

    <h3><small>Step 1</small>Subscribe to the Necessary Mods</h3>

    <p>
        Make sure you are subscribed to the mods that include the map script
        and possibly the data mod that shall be used for the game.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some common mods:
        <a href="https://mods.aoe2.se/94022">King Boom</a>,
        <a href="https://mods.aoe2.se/93961">Exploding Villagers</a>,
        <a href="https://mods.aoe2.se/829">Zetnus HyperRandom</a>,
        <a href="https://mods.aoe2.se/2861">Zetnus Random Map Script Pack (includes Forest Nothing)</a>,
        <a href="https://mods.aoe2.se/3553">Pilgrims Nothing DE</a>,
        <a href="https://mods.aoe2.se/93975">Random Cost Mod</a>.
    </p>


    <h3><small>Step 2</small>Create a Game</h3>

    <p>
        Make sure that <strong>Spectators are enabled</strong> and that,
        if necessary, the correct <strong>data mod</strong> is selected.
    </p>

    <p>
        Choose a simple password that cannot be easily guessed.
    </p>


    <h3><small>Step 3</small>Configure the Game</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Select the map script. Maps from mods can be found under Map Type "Custom".</li>
        <li>Select the map size. Usually Large (8 Players), unless specified otherwise.</li>
        <li>Select the proper game mode.</li>
        <li>Configure diplomacy options. A free-for-all ("FFA") game has the "Fixed Teams" checkbox checked,
            while a diplomacy ("diplo") game has it unchecked.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3><small>Step 4</small>Send the Game Information to T90</h3>

    <p>
        Send the game ID, the password, and a screenshot of your game settings to T90 via Discord direct message.
        There is a button to copy the game ID at the top right,
        and you can take a screenshot by pressing <code>Win+Shift+S</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        T90 will share the game information with the selected players.
    </p>


    <h3><small>Step 5</small>Wait For All the Players to Join</h3>

    <p>
        Wait for all players that have been selected to join the game.
        Make sure no two players pick the same colour, and have them select the correct team.
        Usually that means everybody selects no team (<code>-</code>).
    </p>

    <h3><small>Step 6</small>Start the Game Already!</h3>

    <p>
        Have the players select "I'm Ready!" and click "Start Game". Have fun!
    </p>
